Project Senario

Imagine you work at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on the infectious disease tracking & prevention team and there is currently a world wide virus outbreak that is at pandemic levels. The top public health official at the CDC has asked you to work with the software development team to develop a product that tracks the spread of the virus in an effort to help stop and prevent the virus from spreading further. There is currently no vaccine or cure for the virus and the CDC wants to know where to apply funding, where to send test kits, and eventually be able to track the status of vaccine and cure creation.

Here are a few clear and critical outcomes for the first release of the product to be successful:

It is critical that anyone in the U.S. is able to report that they have contracted the virus
It is critical to show heatmaps of the outbreak
It is critical to be able to track and compare the
Number of virus test kits that health care companies have created.
Number of virus test kits administered by the test centers
It is critical that medical examiners are able to report the number of deaths caused by the virus

Some less important and unclear outcomes for the product are:

Pharmaceutical companies are working on vaccines and cures and need to be able to report on their progress
State and Local Government Officials want to push out updates to the public through the product
Local Doctors need to be able to report successful remedies and cures for patients


With the application of Scrum Framework methodologies, I have created a sample Product Plan, User Stories, Priorities and Release Plan for a Minimun Viable Product in the following files:

Priority.html
Product Roadmap.html
Release Plan&MVP Plan.html
User Roles.html
User Stories.html

The idea is to present what is involved in the decision-making process that leads to the actual Agile Software Development Life Cycle.
From this information, you can run Sprint with all the identified and prioritized incremental deliverables.
